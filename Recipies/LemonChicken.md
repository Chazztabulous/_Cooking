Chicken Breast Instead of Thighs - 
- This recipe can be made with chicken breast instead of thighs. To do so, prepare the chicken using the same method but cook the chicken for 6 minutes instead of 10 minutes. Follow the remaining steps as per normal.

## Method
- Chop broccoli. The stem can be trimmed and chopped for use as well
- Remove the stems and tops from green beans
- Dice chicken
- Make sauce:
    - Add Chicken stock, garlic, lemon juice, onion powder, soy sauce, seasame oil, and cornstarch to mixing bowl. Whisk until smooth
- Cook broccoli over medium/high heat for 3-4 minutes until the color starts to lighten
- Add green beans. Continue sauteing for about 3 minutes
- Add 80ml cold water. Place lid on pan and steam for 2 minutes
- Set veggies aside
- In the same pan, cook chicken thighs over medium to high heat for 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper
    - During cooking, the chicken will release a good amount of moisture. This will be used in our sauce, but if there is quite a lot then remove the liquid
- Add sauce and cook down for 2 minutes, stiring throughout.
    - The purpose of this is to thicken the sauce so it coats the chicken and isnt runny.
