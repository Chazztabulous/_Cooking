This Curried Chicken Soup recipe is easy to make, nice and creamy, perfectly (and fairly lightly) spiced, naturally gluten-free, and mmm mmm good.

TOTAL TIME: 45 MINS PREP TIME: 20 MINS COOK TIME: 25 MINS
INGREDIENTS:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium white onion, peeled and diced
2 large carrots, diced (about 1 cup)
2 stalks celery, diced (about 1 cup)
3 parsnips, matchstick diced (about 1 1/2 cups)
3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
6 cups good-quality chicken stock
1 1/2 lbs cooked, shredded chicken (note to self: brine for 1 day with Smitten brine recipe, poach in water for 15-25 mins until 165 degrees internal temp)
2 1/2 teaspoons curry powder
1 bay leaf
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
3/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly-ground black pepper
1 (14-ounce) can coconut milk (**see note below)
optional garnishes: chopped fresh cilantro, crushed red pepper flakes, shredded coconut
DIRECTIONS:
Heat the olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add the onion, carrots, celery and parsnips and cook for 7-9 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent, stirring occasionally.  Add the garlic, and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant, stirring occasionally.  Add the chicken stock, chicken, curry powder, bay leaf, cumin, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper, and stir to combine.  Stir in the coconut milk until combined.  Continue to cook until the soup reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover partially with a lid, and let the mixture simmer for 20-25 minutes.

Remove the bay leaf.  Then taste the soup, and season with extra salt, pepper, or red pepper flakes if needed.

Serve warm, topped with optional garnishes if desired.

**I used a can of full-fat coconut milk in this recipe.  But you can substitute in light coconut milk instead.  Or if you would rather pass on coconut milk, you can substitute in a can of evaporated milk.
