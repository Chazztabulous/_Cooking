# Ingredients
- 2 lbs Chicken cutlets, tenders or chicken breasts (halved horizontally)
- 2 ½ tsp Salt, divided in 2tsp and ½ tsp
- ½ tsp Pepper
- 1 cup Flour for dredging
- 10 tbsp Butter, cut into pieces,  
- 4 tbsp Olive oil, divided in 2 tbsp batches
- 1 Shallot, minced
- 1 tbsp Garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups Chicken stock
- 1 Lemon juiced (1 tbsp)
- 2 tsp Lemon zest
- 2 tbsp Capers, drained
- Parsley, chopped, for garnish (optional)

# Method
1. Season the chicken with 2 teaspoons salt and pepper on both sides. Place the flour on a plate. Dredge the chicken in the flour and shake off any excess. Discard the flour when finished dredging.

1. Heat 3 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet set over medium-high until the butter has melted.

1. Working in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan, add ½ the chicken and sauté until golden brown, about 2 ½ - 3 minutes per side, until cooked through. Set the chicken aside on a plate when they finish cooking.

1. Add 3 more tablespoons of butter and 2 more tablespoons of olive oil and finish cooking the 2nd batch of chicken.

1. Add the shallot to the pan drippings and sauté until soft and fragrant, about 1 minute. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute longer.

1. Add the stock and simmer until reduced by half, about 4-5 minutes.

1. Reduce heat to low, then stir in the remaining 4 tablespoons butter, capers, lemon juice, and zest to taste. Season with remaining ½ teaspoon of salt. Garnish with parsley if using.

1. Serve the chicken with the piccata sauce poured over the top of the pan-fried chicken, alongside your favorite pasta or salad.
