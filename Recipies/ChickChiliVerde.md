Ingredients
2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
4 tomatillos quartered
3 poblano peppers diced
4 ounces green chili peppers 1 can
1 medium onion diced
3 teaspoons minced garlic
1 Tablespoon cumin
salt to taste
Worcestershire sauce dash
Â½ cup cilantro roughly chopped
3 limes for serving
16 soft taco size tortillas for serving
Instructions
Place chicken thighs, tomatillos, peppers, onion, garlic, cumin, and salt in an Instant Pot. Saute on high for 5-8 minutes, until chicken is lightly seared. Place lid on Instant Pot, seal, and cook manually on high pressure for 15 minutes. When finished, allow pressure to release naturally.
Remove chicken from pot and shred, then set aside.
Add cilantro and Worcestershire sauce to the remaining ingredients in the Instant Pot. Using an immersion blender (or transferring everything in the Instant Pot to a high-power blender), blend until sauce is smooth. Pour sauce over shredded chicken (as much or as little as you want).
Serve warm topped with cilantro, fresh squeezed lime juice, and tortillas.
