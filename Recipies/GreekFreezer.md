# Method
## Prep meal
1. Bring a large stock pot filled with water to the boil. Add one tablespoon of salt along with the potatoes, and boil for 6 minutes. Drain potatoes into a colander and allow them to cool completely.

1. Make the Greek marinade: in a small bowl, combine olive oil, lemon juice, remaining tablespoon of salt, oregano, garlic powder and dill, stir to combine.

1. In a large bowl, toss the cooled, cooked potatoes with half of the Greek marinade until potatoes are coated. Add potatoes to the bottom of a freezer bag. Use the same bowl to toss the chicken breasts with the remaining dressing. Once they’re well coated, add the seasoned chicken breast to the freezer bag along with the potatoes.
