- 1 garlic clove, smashed
- 1 bunch scallions, roughly chopped
- Juice of 1 lemon

# Method

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, 6 to 8 minutes.

1. While the pasta cooks, make the sauce: In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the avocados, garlic, scallions, lemon juice and olive oil until smooth.

1. When the pasta is tender, reserve Â½ tablespoon of the cooking water, then drain the pasta. Add the reserved water to the avocado mixture and process until smooth.
