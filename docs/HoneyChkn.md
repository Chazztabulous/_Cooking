# Ingredients

- 1/2 cup Dijon mustard
- 1/2 cup Honey
- 1 1/2 tsp Salt, divided
- 1 tbsp Apple cider vinegar (optional)
- 1 tsp Paprika
- 1/2 tsp Freshly ground pepper
- 3 tbsp Olive oil
- 1 cup Shallots, roughly chopped
- 1 lb Fingerling potatoes (or yukon golds, cut into 1" pieces)[replace with Daikon or Kholrabi]
- 2-3 Sprigs rosemary, stems removed, chopped
- 1/2 lb Green beans, washed and trimmed
- 2 lbs Boneless skinless chicken breasts

# Method

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.

1. In a small bowl, make the honey-mustard sauce. Combine the Dijon mustard, honey, 1/2 teaspoon salt, apple cider vinegar and paprika. Stir until smooth.

1. Lightly season the chicken breasts with 1 teaspoon salt and pepper.

1. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large oven proof skillet or braiser over medium high heat. Sear the chicken until golden brown, about 3 minutes each side. Remove from the skillet onto a plate.

1. Add the shallots and fingerling potatoes along with the remaining olive oil into the braiser and toss to combine. Sprinkle with rosemary and place in oven for 30 minutes.

1. After 30 minutes, add the green beans and chicken along with any juices to the pan.

1. Continue cooking for another 15 minutes. Lastly, toss the chicken and veggies with the sauce and let it cook for 10-15 more minutes longer or until the chicken has reached 165°F with an instant-read thermometer.
